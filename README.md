Hello, world.

Hello!

My name is Taylor Prescott. I too have had tacos on the moon, but found earth tacos to be far superior. I'm interested in anything related to technology, and spend the vast majority of my free time learning and practicing coding.

My focus is web development on both the front and backend. I'm comfortable with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and can also use PHP, mySQL, and Node.js.
